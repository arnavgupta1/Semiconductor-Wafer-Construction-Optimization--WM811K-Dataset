This is a model that uses the data of the WM811K dataset. It implements a deep learning model that learns from the dataset
and categorizes the wafers based on the data it receives. 

The data is scaled down to the same size, done by the PIL library, in order for the model to intake all input the same way. The
model is made using the Tensorflow library as well as the Keras API. In order for the output to be different categories, the
input goes through One-Hot Encoding so it is clear what the category it is placed in is.

WM811K dataset is not available in this respository, but can be sent via direct inquiry.
